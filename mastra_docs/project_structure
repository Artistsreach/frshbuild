Project Structure
This page provides a guide for organizing folders and files in Mastra. Mastra is a modular framework, and you can use any of the modules separately or together.

You could write everything in a single file, or separate each agent, tool, and workflow into their own files.

We donâ€™t enforce a specific folder structure, but we do recommend some best practices, and the CLI will scaffold a project with a sensible structure.

Example Project Structure
A default project created with the CLI looks like this:

Top-level Folders
Folder	Description
src/mastra	Core application folder
src/mastra/agents	Agent configurations and definitions
src/mastra/tools	Custom tool definitions
src/mastra/workflows	Workflow definitions
Top-level Files
File	Description
src/mastra/index.ts	Main configuration file for Mastra
.env	Environment variables
package.json	Node.js project metadata, scripts, and dependencies
tsconfig.json	TypeScript compiler configuration
