Create Mintable Wallets
post
https://api.mintology.app/v1/custodial-wallets
IMPORTANT: Call from the back-end.

Create a new Mintable Wallet. This also creates a Mintable account, so users have the ability to claim custody of their private keys. Please note that a username can be provided: if you do not provide a username, a random one will be generated and the user will be able to modify it from the Mintable website. This is a display name used on the site to reference the user, since the email address is confidential.

This endpoint should always be called from your backend to prevent any potential spamming or exposing your private API key.

Body Params
email
string
required
The email address of the user whose wallet to find

username
string
Optional: Username that has a Mintable.com account with a wallet connected to that username.

  Remove Mintable Wallets
delete
https://api.mintology.app/v1/custodial-wallets/{walletAddress}
IMPORTANT: Call from the back-end.

Once a user has taken custody of their Mintable Wallet, this permanently removes the private key from our systems. To ensure the user has indeed received and stored their private key, we require you to send us a hash of the last 8 characters of the key itself: once we have checked it against the actual key and, if the match is successful, we delete the key. The hash function used here is SHA-256 (please see this example).

This endpoint should always be called from your backend to prevent any potential spamming or exposing your private API key.

  Request To Export
post
https://api.mintology.app/v1/custodial-wallets/{walletAddress}/exports/request
IMPORTANT: Call from the back-end.

When a user wants to take custody of their Mintable Wallet, you can call this endpoint to initiate the process. When you call the endpoint, we will send an email to the user, with an OTP which will have to be provided to access the private key of the wallet. This flow ensures that the request was indeed initiated by the user, since we will be sending this email from our systems. In order to access the private key, both the OTP sent to the user, and the request ID returned by this endpoint will have to be provided.

This endpoint should always be called from your backend to prevent any potential spamming or exposing your private API key.
